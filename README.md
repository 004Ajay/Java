[FileProgram 4 - Read a line of integers & then displays each integer](https://github.com/004Ajay/Java/blob/main/FileProgram4.java)

[Inheritance Employees & Manager - Java program which creates a class named 'Employee' having the following members: Name, Age, Phone number, Address, Salary. It also has a method named 'printSalary( )' which prints the salary of the Employee. Two classes 'Officer' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Employee' class. The 'Officer' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an officer and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and print the same](https://github.com/004Ajay/Java/blob/main/Employees.java)

[Inheritance Engineer & Employee - Java program which creates two classes Employee and Engineer. Engineer should inherit from Employee class. Employee class to have two methods display() and calcSalary(), on which Gross Salary of employee is calculated using user inputs and display the engineer salary from engineer class(twice of salary of employee), Employee class using a single object instantiation (i.e., only one object creation is allowed). display() only prints the name of the class and does not return any value. Ex. Name of class is Employee. calcSalary() in Employee displays- Salary of employee is 10000 and calcSalary() in Engineer displays Salary of Engineer as twice of salary of employee](https://github.com/004Ajay/Java/blob/main/EngineerEmployee.java)
